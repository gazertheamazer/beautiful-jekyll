title: Visualizing F.O.I.L. with Rectangles
subtitle: What does (a+b)(a+b) Really Mean?
categories: Math

In high school we commonly learn the F.O.I.L technique (First - Outside - Inside - Last) to expand a binomial like this: <br />

$$(a+b)^{2}=(a+b)(a+b)=a^{2}+2ab+b^{2}$$

Great, but why this rule? Notice that above we are **squaring** the quantity $(a+b)$. 
**The square of any number yields the area of the square, whose sidelengths are that number!** 
For example, squaring the number 10 will yield 100 which is the area of a square with side length 10: <br />

Given two positive numbers $a$ and $b$ (eg. 2 and 6, or 19 and 88), what is the area of a square whose sidelength is $a+b$? It seems the area should be exactly $(a+b)^{2}$. When we really _compute_ this value, we FOIL it, yielding:
<p align='center'>
Area = $(a+b)^{2}=(a+b)(a+b)=a^{2}+2ab+b^{2}$
  </p>

To imagine the right-hand-side, let's re-draw our square explicitly showing the lengths $a$ and $b$: <br />

Cool! **The total area of the square is just the sum of the smaller inner areas**: a red square of area $a^{2}$, a green square of area $b^{2}$, and two identical blue rectangles of area $ab$. 
Since we've confirmed these areas are identical, we learn that the FOIL rule is rooted in simple area geometry. <br />

**Apply the Result:** Can you explain FOIL-ing $(a+b+c)^{2}$ or $(a+b+c+d+.....+z)^{2}$?
