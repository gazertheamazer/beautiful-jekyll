title: Visualizing F.O.I.L. with Rectangles
subtitle: What does (a+b)(a+b) Really Mean?

In high school, we commonly learn the F.O.I.L (First - Outside - Inside - Last) technique to expand a binomial like this: <br />

$$(a+b)^{2}=(a+b)(a+b)=a^{2}+2ab+b^{2}$$

Great. But why this rule? What does FOILING really represent? Notice that above we are squaring the quantity $(a+b)$. Squaring the number 10 will yield 100, the area of a square with side length 10: <br />

The gist is, squaring any number yields the area of the square with that number as the side length! So, for a square whose side length is $(a+b)$ the area should be exactly $(a+b)^{2}$. This is straightforward, but what do we make of the right-hand-side of Eq. \ref{eq:1}, $a^{2}+2ab+b^{2}$? Think carefully about how the area of the square would change if we made $a$ or $b$ larger. Let's re-draw our square explicitly showing the lengths $a$ and $b$: <br />

Cool! The total area of the square is just the sum of the smaller inner areas: a square of area $a^{2}$, a square of area $b^{2}$, and two identical rectangles of area $ab$. <br />

Challenge: Can we use the same reasoning to compute $(a+b+c)^{2}$?
