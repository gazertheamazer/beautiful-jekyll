If you were shown a wiggly rope like this:

How could you compute the total LENGTH of the rope $L$ _without straightening it_?

In mathematical terms, the "wiggly rope problem" really means "finding the arc length of a function $f(x)$".   
Given some (potentially wiggly) function $f(x)$, the total length of the rope is simply the sum of all the small little lengths of rope $\Delta L$ along the way.
We can approximate each little length of rope by a straight line, assuming we use really small bits like this:
(show image with little tiny steps along the way)
To justify this, any part of a wiggly rope looks flat if you zoom in close enough.
Then, the total length $L$ is "the sum of all $\Delta L$ pieces from the beginning to the end of the rope".
Each $Delta L$ is of length:





Mathematically speaking, in the limit of $\Delta x$ -> 0 the Taylor Expansion of $f(x)$ collapses to the linear term.

This question has two answers, depending on what we mean by the phrase _how far_.

Let's take a look at the trajectory of the ball. 
(insert image!)
Do we want to compute how far the ball is _from us when it lands_ (the **displacement**) or how far the ball travelled _along it's total flight path_ (the **distance**). 
The (horizontal) displacement of the ball is referred to as the _range_ (like the range of an artillery shell) and can be computed quite easily using any of the projectile-motion equations.

The total distance of the flight path is (slightly) less trivial.
The distance is how many meters did travelled along it's entire path: ie. the number of steps on the ball's FitBit, or the number of meters shown on its odometer.

{: .box-note} 
The total distance travelled along the parabola is called the **arc length** of $y = f(x)$.

If you'd like to find the arc length of a function, simply get a tape measure, bend it along the entire function, and take a reading. Voila! This is the arc length. In practice, simply knowing the function $f(x)$ itself is sufficient!




For a function simple function of one variable $y=f(x)$






In high school we commonly learn the F.O.I.L technique (First - Outside - Inside - Last) to expand a binomial like this: <br />

$$(a+b)^{2}=(a+b)(a+b)=a^{2}+2ab+b^{2}$$

Great, but why this rule? Notice that above we are **squaring** the quantity $(a+b)$. 
**The square of any number yields the area of the square, whose sidelengths are that number!** 
For example, squaring the number 10 will yield 100 which is the area of a square with side length 10: <br />

Given two positive numbers $a$ and $b$ (eg. 2 and 6, or 19 and 88), what is the area of a square whose sidelength is $a+b$? It seems the area should be exactly $(a+b)^{2}$. When we really _compute_ this value, we FOIL it, yielding:
<p align='center'>
Area = $(a+b)^{2}=(a+b)(a+b)=a^{2}+2ab+b^{2}$
  </p>

To imagine the right-hand-side, let's re-draw our square explicitly showing the lengths $a$ and $b$: <br />

Cool! **The total area of the square is just the sum of the smaller inner areas**: a red square of area $a^{2}$, a green square of area $b^{2}$, and two identical blue rectangles of area $ab$. 
Since we've confirmed these areas are identical, we learn that the FOIL rule is rooted in simple area geometry. <br />

**Apply the Result:** Can you explain FOIL-ing $(a+b+c)^{2}$ or $(a+b+c+d+.....+z)^{2}$?
