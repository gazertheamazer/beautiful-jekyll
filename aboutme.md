title: About Me
---

My name is Reuben Gazer and I am a 24 year old data engineer and analyst, astrophysics enthusiast, science educator and magician currently living in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada. 
I recently graduated from the University of Alberta (MSc. Astrophysics) where I conducted research in stellar and computational astrophysics under Dr. Craig O. Heinke. I am passionate about the public pursuit of science and frequently conduct outreach in the form of lectures and talks (some of which can be found <a href=""></a>). On the side, I tutor > 15 different students University-level physics, chemistry, mathematics and astronomy. Hopefully, it is here I will host a cogent set of lecture notes for the topics which I frequently teach. Stay tuned!

I have a range of interests, hobbies and skills that include (but are not limited to): 

- Software development
- Writing, Producing and Recording Music
- Playing Ice Hockey, Squash, Ultimate Frisbee and Rockclimbing
- Magic (www.gazertheamazer.com)
- Jazz Trumpet
